Learning to use react-modal package. It uses react portal under the hood

What I learn/practice:
 * Add preventDefault to button and link to prevent re-navigation
 * Using simple transition
 * Use tailwind for styling

TODO : move animation.css into tailwind.css (I still can't figure it out why it doesn't work)
